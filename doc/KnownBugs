This file describes known bugs in Jazz, or bugs in Java that affect Jazz.

  * 07/14/1999: BBB - Java does not manage very small fonts properly.  
    If you create a Java font that is less than one pixel high, and use 
    it to create a Jazz text object, then that text object will not work
    properly, or perhaps not at all.  The text may not be rendered properly, 
    or not at all.

    The workaround is to create a larger font, but scale down the Jazz node
    that contains the text object that uses that font.  I.e., if you want
    a font that is 0.1 pixels high, you should create a font that is 10
    pixels high, but then set the scale of the corresponding node to 0.01.

    This bug existed as of Sun JDK 1.2.2
