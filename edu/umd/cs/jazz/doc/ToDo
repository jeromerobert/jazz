Jazz ToDo List

  BUGS
  ----

  * 06/15/1999: BBB/JJM - The bounding box of ZText is not being
    computed exactly.   Since the text is rendered differently at
    different sizes in low quality mode, its actual bounds shifts
    around while the bounds that we compute is fixed - and thus
    they are off somewhat.

  * 06/14/1999: BBB - Changing the transform of nodes with sticky
    object decorators doesn't do what the user might want.  It does
    do the right thing mathematically, but that might not be what
    the caller is expecting.  This affects selection of sticky
    objects in the HiNote application.

  * 05/28/1999: BBB - Animating a node with no visual component,
    but with children doesn't work for Jim Mokwa.

  * 05/07/1999: BBB - Fix printing of images on HP DeskJet 890C
    Images don't seem to print, even though they work on other printers.

  FEATURES NEEDED
  ---------------

  * 06/10/1999: BBB - Make volatile objects use a more general kind ZContext
    class so that we can have general context-sensitive objects, that define
    rendering, bounds, and other stuff.  The crucial part is that bounds should
    be able to be determined by the context so, for example, we can have 
    single-pixel thick lines within *all* cameras, instead of just one.

  * 05/28/1999: BBB - Pick should return an application-specific
    integer that allows an application to be more specific about
    what was picked.

  * 05/10/1999: BBB - Add option to limit zooming in ZoomEventHandlerRightButton

  * 05/07/1999: BBB - Support Jazz running within components with Borders 

  * 05/07/1999: BBB - Add 'select group members' option to pick
    Want to be able to have control over whether
    picking picks a group, or a member (i.e., a node or its children)

  * 05/07/1999: BBB - Multiple Camera Application
    An internal camera should have some window dressing that can be used to pick
    the camera as an object.

  * 05/07/1999: BBB - Add open arrowhead support for ZPolyline

  * 05/07/1999: BBB - Design Event structure

  * 05/07/1999: BBB - Design Layout Manager structure

  * 05/07/1999: BBB - Design Lenses
