  FEATURES NEEDED
  ---------------

  * 10/22/1999: BBB - Add (x, y) offset to ZText and ZImage
    Requested by Carol Chapman, Lockheed Martin

  * 09/15/1999: BBB - Add spatial index node to improve rendering of nodes
    with a lot of children.

  * 09/15/1999: BBB - Add support for Advanced Imaging API

  * 09/01/1999: BBB - General purpose Animation support, including
    asynchronous animation.

  * 07/15/1999: BBB - Add tutorial chapter describing how to build and install jazz.

  * 06/10/1999: BBB - Make volatile objects use a more general kind ZContext
    class so that we can have general context-sensitive objects, that define
    rendering, bounds, and other stuff.  The crucial part is that bounds should
    be able to be determined by the context so, for example, we can have 
    single-pixel thick lines within *all* cameras, instead of just one.
      - Suggested by Susanne Jul

  * 05/07/1999: BBB - Design complex composable Lenses
