Jazz ToDo List

  BUGS
  ----

  * 07/08/1999: BBB - The ZSelectionEventHandler maybe have some small bugs 
    when three or more hierarchies are used.

    First, if a ZNode in the third or deeper is seleted, the scaling
    transformations inherited from its upper father(s) will be applied to 
    this ZNode. So, in the mouseDragged method, the statement

       preTranslate(selNode, dx, dy);

    should not be so simple. If in this way, this ZNode will move at a
    faster or slower speed, rather than the desired speed. In our current work,
    I extracted the scaling transform information from all ancestors in 
    hierarchy by querying the current parent and then applied them to dx, dy.

    Second, when seleting multiple nodes and then moving them, only those
    nodes without selected parents or ancestors should be moved. Otherwise 
    the scaling transformation from ancestors will be applied to offspring 
    nodes.

    Maybe you have more simple way to fix them. I am always confused when
    using transform.

  * 07/08/1999: BBB - ZText is not always refreshed in the proper
    final font.  Sometimes it is refreshed in the "zooming" font.

  * 06/15/1999: BBB/JJM - The bounding box of ZText is not being
    computed exactly.   Since the text is rendered differently at
    different sizes in low quality mode, its actual bounds shifts
    around while the bounds that we compute is fixed - and thus
    they are off somewhat.

  * 06/14/1999: BBB - Changing the transform of nodes with sticky
    object decorators doesn't do what the user might want.  It does
    do the right thing mathematically, but that might not be what
    the caller is expecting.  This affects selection of sticky
    objects in the HiNote application.

  * 05/07/1999: BBB - Fix printing of images on HP DeskJet 890C
    Images don't seem to print, even though they work on other printers.

  FEATURES NEEDED
  ---------------

  * 07/15/1999: BBB - Add tutorial describing how to build and install jazz.

  * 07/11/1999: BBB - Add camera view transform events

  * 06/10/1999: BBB - Make volatile objects use a more general kind ZContext
    class so that we can have general context-sensitive objects, that define
    rendering, bounds, and other stuff.  The crucial part is that bounds should
    be able to be determined by the context so, for example, we can have 
    single-pixel thick lines within *all* cameras, instead of just one.
      - Suggested by Susanne Jul

  * 05/28/1999: BBB - Pick should return an application-specific
    integer that allows an application to be more specific about
    what was picked.

  * 05/07/1999: BBB - Support Jazz running within components with Borders 

  * 05/07/1999: BBB - Multiple Camera Application
    An internal camera should have some window dressing that can be used to pick
    the camera as an object.

  * 05/07/1999: BBB - Design Lenses
